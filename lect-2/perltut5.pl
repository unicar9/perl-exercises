# (5) Modify your answer from 4 so that it now accepts all numbers between 5999.99 and 0. The program should also accept integers between 5999 and 0 and floating point numbers between 5999.99 and .00 If the user enters a decimal point, it must have at least one and a maximum of two digits after the decimal point. i.e. numbers like 123.1, 123.11, and 123.01 are all acceptable but 123. Is not acceptable. Also a bare 0 is acceptable.
