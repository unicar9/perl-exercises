# (1) Write a perl program that prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms and their height in centimeters. The program should then print the userâ€™s Body Mass Index (BMI). Body Mass Index is the their weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. To convert centimeters to meters divide by 100.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

print "Please enter your weight in kilograms: ";
my $weight = <STDIN>;
chomp $weight;

print "Please enter your height in centimeters: ";
my $height = <STDIN>;
chomp $height;

my $bmi = $weight / ($height / 100) ** 2;
print "Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is $bmi\n";
