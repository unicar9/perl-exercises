# (8) Modify your program from question 4 so that when the program runs, the user enters the Celsius temperature as an argument to the program. If there is no argument supplied the program should print a message “Please supply the Celsius temperature as an argument” and then exit. If the user runs the program with a non numeric argument the program should print “Please supply a numeric argument” and then exit.
